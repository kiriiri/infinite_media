    <p class="aboutme">Hey there,</p>
    <p class="aboutme">My name is Eric Nyangoya Okemwa,I'm a photographer,videographer and a digital marketer based in Nairobi,kenya.</p>
    <p class="aboutme">I started my photography company,Infinite Media Photography,back in 2012.I personally started photography because it is the only form of communication that can't be misinterpreted by anyone looking at the pictures, you either happy or sad,surprised or in pain.</p>
    <p class="aboutme">What I'm trying to say, is that photography for me is exactly what you see,no filter.For eight years now,I've been capturing moments for people and honestly this isn't just a job for me,it's who I am.I love being able to give people something worthwhile and making the most out of their moments into wonderful memories.That's Me.</p>
